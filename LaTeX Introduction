LaTeX is a free document presentation system, but it is not a word processor. LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content. 

 

School of Finance published the layout of dissertations, say 20 pt Times Roman for the title, 12 pt Times Italic for the name, and so on. This has two results: either wasting time with designs, or a lot of badly designed documents. For this reason, the academic board of School of Finance has decided that all international students (undergraduates and postgraduates) are required to use LaTeX to generate reports, individual assignments, group assignments, and dissertations from May 25th, 2018. 

 

LaTeX is based on the idea that it is better to leave document design to document designers, and to let authors get on with writing documents. So, in LaTeX you would input a document as: 

 

\documentclass{article}

\title{The Effect of Government Expenditure on Real Exchange Rate}

\author{Jane Doe}

\date{September 2018}

\begin{document}

   \maketitle

   Hello world!

\end{document}
